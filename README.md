## AeroGear Unified Push Server Admin UI

### Setting Up The Development Environment

Pre-reqs:

* Node.js - [Download Here](http://nodejs.org/)
* Bower( version of 0.9.1 or Greater ) - [Download Here](http://bower.io/)
* Knowledge of Ember.js

Once the pre-reqs have been taken care of, run:

    npm install

    bower install

To run:

    grunt server

To create a distribtion:

    grunt


### Using Mocks

If you want to use the mocks to test,  uncomment these lines from index.html

    <script src="bower_components/jquery-mockjax/jquery.mockjax.js"></script>
    <script src="scripts/mocks/mock.js"></script>

Then run

    grunt server


### Using With JBoss EAP/Wildfly

_note:  The current version of the Unified Push Server now has the the Admin UI distribution "installed",  for development, the instructions below still apply_

Clone and run [https://github.com/aerogear/aerogear-unified-push-server](unified push server) as an exploded war.

Then run ``` grunt initLocalConfig ``` this will create a ``` local-config.json ``` file. Open it and edit the "webapp" and "jbossweb" config params:

   {
       "home": "/home/sebastien/aerogear/aerogear-unified-push-server-admin-ui",
       "webapp": "/home/sebastien/aerogear/aerogear-unifiedpush-server/src/main/webapp",
       "jbossweb": "/home/sebastien/apps/jboss-as-7.1.1.Final/standalone/deployments/ag-push.war",
       "ups_repo": "/home/sebastien/aerogear/ui_update/aerogear-unifiedpush-server"
    };

This will copy the contents to the "root" folder of both the cloned repo and the exploded war file( to keep them N'sync )

"webapp" should be the path where you cloned the push server.

"jbossweb" is the path of you exploded war running on an app server

_Eventually, this should just be the contents of the dist folder,   but for testing, well, you know_

_Make sure to rerun "grunt server" once you change these parameters_

Now everytime you save a file, grunt is watching and will copy to these directories

### Handlebar templates

This project uses handlebar templates( *.hbs )

Grunt is watching for changes in the "templates" directory and will recomplile "scripts/templates.js" with the new template

### Making a release

There is a Grunt task to perform a release, please refer to this [doc](https://github.com/aerogear/collateral/wiki/UPS-Admin-Console-Process) for more information and instructions.

### Known Issues

Sometimes the incorrect version of ember templates gets installed when doing a clean `npm install` , running `npm install` a second time can fix it
